# AI-Powered Project & Resource Management Intelligence Platform

A next-generation, enterprise-grade web application purpose-built to help software development teams efficiently manage complex project lifecycles, sprint planning, developer task allocation, and delivery timelines.

By seamlessly integrating predictive AI analytics, real-time WebSocket communication, and rich data visualizations, this platform transcends conventional task trackers. It acts as an intelligent, centralized hub that surfaces potential bottlenecks *before* they materialize, empowering managers to proactively rebalance workloads and mitigate delivery risk.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Intelligent Sprint Planning:** AI-assisted story-point estimation and team-capacity analysis.
- **Delay Prediction Engine:** Scikit-learn models trained on historical velocity data flag at-risk sprints in real time.
- **Live Kanban Board:** WebSocket-powered drag-and-drop board with instant multi-user synchronization.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin, Manager, and Developer hierarchy with JWT-secured endpoints.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Recharts-driven velocity, burn-down, and utilization graphs refreshed on every sprint update.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Fully containerized via Docker Compose and deployed on AWS EC2 with S3-backed file storage.

## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

The entire application ecosystem is containerized to guarantee environment parity between local development and production.

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (for local frontend/websocket development)
- Java 21 & Maven (for local Spring Boot development)
- Python 3.11 (for local ML service development)

### Running the Full Stack via Docker

You can spin up the entire application suite (Frontend, Spring Boot, FastAPI, Node.js, and PostgreSQL) using a single command from the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Accessing the Services

Once the containers are running, the services will be exposed on the following ports:

| Service | URL |
|----------|------|
| Frontend UI | http://localhost:5173 |
| Spring Boot API | http://localhost:8080 |
| Python ML Service | http://localhost:8000 |
| Node WebSocket Server | http://localhost:3000 |
